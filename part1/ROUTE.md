# Part 1 - Network Access

In the previous section you configured your raspberry pi systems to create a mesh network.  Before we start up the mesh network we need to make sure you will be able to access the devices forming the mesh and also allow the mesh devices to access the Internet.

In this section you will add a gateway device to allow the mesh traffic to be routed to the Internet, but keeping the mesh network private from your home or office network.  You will also create a bridge device to allow your laptop or any other device to access mesh devices or access the Internet via the mesh network.

## Gateways and bridges

![network diagram](/images/PiMesh.png)

This workshop shows 2 different ways of connecting netowrks.  A Gateway device and a bridge device, so what is the difference?

A Gateway:

- hides the second network (the mesh network in diagram above) from the primary network (home/office network in diagram)
- appears on the primary network as a standard device and by default prevents other devices on the primary network seeing devices on the second network
- allows devices on the second network to see devices on the primary network using a technique called Network Address Translation (NAT), which sends all traffic originating on the second network destined for the primary network (or Internet) as if it had been generated by the gateway device, then when a response is received it *translates* the destination address to the originating device on the second network.
- not all traffic from the primary network is sent to the second network.  By default, only responses to traffic originating on the second network is forwarded by the gateway, though additional rules can be added to allow other traffic to be routed from the primary network to the second network.
- the devices on the second network need to have a different IP address range, so the gateway can determine how to route traffic
- most home and office internet access devices are gateways, preventing internet traffic seeing into your home network, but allowing devices on your home network to access the internet.
- for more technical folks, this is a layer-3 routing solution (don't worry if your don't understand what this means)

A bridge:

- simply joins 2 different network interfaces and makes them appear to be a single network
- all network traffic flows across the bridge from both networks
- the 2 networks share the same IP address space, there is no routing
- for more technical folks, this is a layer-2 solution

You could choose to implement 2 bridges or 2 gateways depending on how you want to separate the networks.  The step-by-step instructions will implement a gateway and a bridge, as shown in the diagram above.

The instructions below will be using the Ethernet connection on a Pi 3B, if you can't use Ethernet and need to use WiFi then jump to part 2, where WiFi connectivity is covered (you will need additional WiFi USB dongles).

## Creating the gateway

In this section you will convert one of your mesh Raspberry Pi 3B devices to act as a gateway between your existing home/office network and the Mesh network.  You should connect the Pi to your home/office network via Ethernet cable (eth0 interface on the Raspberry Pi).

As the gateway uses IP routing to selectively allow traffic to pass between the Mesh  and home/office networks the Mesh network needs to have a different address range.  The instructions use the following network details:

- Network 192.168.199.x
- netmask 255.255.255.0
- gateway address 192.168.0.1

The gateway will be the DHCP server for the mesh network.

On the selected Pi that will be the gateway complete the following steps on the command line:

1. Install the DHCP software with command : ```sudo apt-get install -y dnsmasq```
2. Configure the DHCP server by editing the dnsmasq.conf file as root user:

    - ```sudo vi /etc/dnsmasq.conf```
    - ```sudo nano /etc/dnsmasq.conf```

    and add the following lines to the end of the file:

    ```text
    interface=bat0
    dhcp-range=192.168.199.2,192.168.199.99,255.255.255.0,12h
    ```

3. Update the bat0 interface definition by editing file /etc/network/interfaces.d/bat0 as root user.  Change the content to be:

    ```text
    auto bat0
    iface bat0 inet manual
        pre-up /usr/sbin/batctl if add wlan0
    ```

4. Change the startup file to add the routing rules to forward mesh traffic to the home/office network and do the Network Address Translation on the reply.  Set the node as a mesh gateway and also configure the gateway interface IP address.  To do this update the **start-batman-adv.sh** file and change the content to:

    ```text
    #!/bin/bash
    # batman-adv interface to use
    sudo batctl if add wlan0
    sudo ifconfig bat0 mtu 1468

    # Tell batman-adv this is an internet gateway
    sudo batctl gw_mode server

    # Enable port forwarding
    sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
    sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
    sudo iptables -A FORWARD -i eth0 -o bat0 -m conntrack --ctstate RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
    sudo iptables -A FORWARD -i bat0 -o eth0 -j ACCEPT

    # Activates batman-adv interfaces
    sudo ifconfig wlan0 up
    sudo ifconfig bat0 up
    sudo ifconfig bat0 192.168.199.1/24
    ```

5. Shutdown the gateway pi using command ```sudo shutdown -h now```

## Creating a bridge node

In this section you will convert one of the mesh Raspberry Pi devices to a bridge (this cannot be the gateway device).  The bridge will connect the Raspberry Pi ethernet interface to the mesh network interface.

A bridge node allows non-mesh devices to use the mesh nodes to connect to the home/office network and the Internet.  The gateway node provides the DHCP server that will also serve bridged devices, as DHCP requests flow over a bridge.

On the selected bridge node run the following on a command line:

1. Install the bridge utilities using command : ```sudo apt-get install -y bridge-utils```
2. Update the bat0 interface definition by editing file /etc/network/interfaces.d/bat0 as root user.  Change the content to be:

    ```text
    auto bat0
    iface bat0 inet manual
        pre-up /usr/sbin/batctl if add wlan0
    ```

3. Create an interface config for the eth0 interface.  This will allow the ethernet port to be *hotplugged*, which means the ethernet cable can be connected and disconnected.  Do this by creating file /etc/network/interfaces.d/eth0 as root user and setting the content to:

    ```text
    auto eth0
    allow-hotplug eth0
    iface eth0 inet manual
    ```

4. Modify the /etc/dhcpcd.conf file as root use and change the last line to:

    ```text
    denyinterfaces wlan0 eth0 bat0
    ```

5. Update the configuration file ~/start-batman-adv.sh to setup the bridge

    ```text
    #!/bin/bash
    # batman-adv interface to use
    sudo batctl if add wlan0
    sudo ifconfig bat0 mtu 1468

    sudo brctl addbr br0
    sudo brctl addif br0 eth0 bat0

    # Tell batman-adv this is a gateway client
    sudo batctl gw_mode client

    # Activates batman-adv interfaces
    sudo ifconfig wlan0 up
    sudo ifconfig bat0 up
    ```

6. Shutdown the bridge pi using command ```sudo shutdown -h now```

## Boot the mesh network

Now you have completed the configuration and setup you can boot your mesh network.  Ensure the gateway node is connected to the home/office network via Ethernet cable then power on all the Raspberry Pis.

After a short while the mesh should have formed and each mesh node should have an IP address.

### Verifying the gateway

To verify that your mesh network is working you should have your laptop connected to your home/office network, then complete the following:

1. Connect to the gateway using ssh :

    ```ssh pi@hostname.local```

    replacing the hostname with the hostname of your gateway pi.

2. Issue command ```ifconfig``` on a command line on the gateway pi.  You should see all the interfaces on your gateway pi:

    ```text

            TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0
    ```

    Notice that:
    - eth0 has an IP address on your home/office network
    - bat0 has IP address 192.168.199.1
    - wlan0 has no IP address assigned

3. Issue command ```iwconfig``` to show the wireless interfaces on the device.  You should see:

    ```text
    wlan0   IEEE 802.11  ESSID:"call-code-mesh"  
            Mode:Ad-Hoc  Frequency:2.462 GHz  Cell: 3A:BC:74:3B:A1:D9
            Tx-Power=31 dBm
            Retry short limit:7   RTS thr:off   Fragment thr:off
            Power Management:on
    ```

    Notice that:

    - The ESSID is the name of your network, set in /etc/network/interfaces.d/wlan0
    - The mode is Ad-Hoc

4. Issue command ```sudo batctl if``` to show the interfaces participating in the mesh.  You should see response ```wlan0: active``` to show that the WiFi interface wlan0 is part of the mesh.
5. Issue command ```sudo batctl n``` to show the neighbouring mesh nodes your gateway node can see. You should see something similar to this:

    ```text
    [B.A.T.M.A.N. adv 2017.3, MainIF/MAC: wlan0/b8:27:eb:8e:ec:6c (bat0/ba:bf:0a:fd:33:e5 BATMAN_IV)]
    IF             Neighbor              last-seen
    wlan0     b8:27:eb:bd:4d:e5    0.980s
    wlan0     b8:27:eb:01:d4:bb    0.730s
    ```

### Verify the bridge

1. Now connect your laptop to the Ethernet port on the bridge node.  
2. Give it a short while to get an IP address then check that the laptop has got a 192.168.199.x IP address, this will verify that your laptop is able to use the mesh to get to the gateway node, where the DHCP server is running.  If you get a 169.x.x.x network address then there is an issue with the bridge.
3. Connect to the bridge pi using ```ssh pi@hostname.local```, changing **hostname**
with the hostname of your bridge raspberry pi.
4. Issue command ifconfig to see all the interfaces on the bridge pi.  You should see something similar to:

    ```text
        bat0: flags=4163<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST>  mtu 1468

        wlan0: flags=4163<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500
                inet6 fe80::ba27:ebff:febd:4de5  prefixlen 64  scopeid 0x20<link>
                ether b8:27:eb:bd:4d:e5  txqueuelen 1000  (Ethernet)

                TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0
    ```

    Notice:

    - The br0 interface has an IP address in the mesh network range.
    - The bat0, eth0 and wlan0 interfaces have no IP address assigned.

5. Issue command ```sudo brctl show``` to show the details of defined bridge interfaces.  The response should show that bat0 and eth0 are configured in the bridge interface:

    ```text
    bridge name	bridge id	    STP enabled	interfaces
    br0		8000.b827ebe818b0	no		bat0
                                        eth0
    ```

Once your laptop is connected to the bridge node and has an IP address in the mesh network it will be able to directly connect to all the nodes in the mesh and also access any computer on the home/office network and the Internet.  Try issuing command ```ping www.ibm.com -c 5```, where you should get an response similar to:

    ```text

    ```

    which shows your laptop is accessing the home/office network and the internet.

    From the home/office network you can only access the gateway device.  It is not possible to see the other nodes making up the mesh or devices bridged onto the mesh.  If you want to contact those devices then log onto the gateway node, then you can use the gateway device command line to access all the mesh and bridged devices.

    When you are connected via the mesh network you may find some services do not work when on the mesh, such as some wireless print services or media services.  This is because they rely on network broadcast traffic.  
    
    Broadcast traffic from the home/office network does not get sent to the mesh network.  If you need this behaviour then you can replace the gateway node with another bridge node to bridge the mesh network to your home/office network.  Bridging to your mesh network is not advisable if your home/office netowrk is a busy network, as you may flood the mesh network.
